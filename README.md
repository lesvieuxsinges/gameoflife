Our own version of the game of life. It features 693 possible structures. These are implemented from the Life Lexicon made by Stephen A. Silver, Dave Greene and David Bell (https://conwaylife.com/ref/lexicon/lex.htm). Have fun !

Libraries needed :
The libraries needed are all included in Python 3 :
tkinter, urllib3, re, os

How does it work :

Choose the parameters you want in the terminal, and the structures you want to put.
